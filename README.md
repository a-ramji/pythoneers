### What is `SciPy`?
`SciPy` is an open-source Python library which is used for scientific and technical computing. It is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the `NumPy` extension of Python. Allows the user to manipulate and visualize data with a wide range of high-level commands.

Some of the key features and submodules of `SciPy` include:
- Integration&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (`scipy.integrate`)
- Optimization&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (`scipy.optimize`)
- Signal Processing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (`scipy.signal`)
- Linear Algebra&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (`scipy.linalg`)
- Statistics&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (`scipy.stats`)
- Interpolation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (`scipy.interpolate`)
- Special Functions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (`scipy.special`)
- **Scientific Python Statistics**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (`scipy.stats`)
- **Vector Quantization**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (`scipy.cluster.vq`)

These features make `SciPy` an essential tool for scientists, engineers, and researchers who work with complex mathematical and scientific problems.

### Who Created It?
`SciPy` was created by a community of developers and contributors rather than a single individual. It was originally developed by Travis Olliphant, who is a prominent figure in the Python scientific computing community. 

Travis Olliphant started the `SciPy` project in the late 1990s in order to address the need for a comprehensive library for scientific and technical computing in Python. He also played a significant role in the development of NumPy, which is a fundamental component of `SciPy`.

*** Uses in Environmental Data Science

Data Preprocessing

-	Numerical Integration

-	Optimization

-	Spatial Analysis

-	Signal Processing

-	Interpolation

-	Simulation and Modeling

-	Geospatial Data

-	Image Processing

-	**Statistical Analysis**: Environmental data scientists use statistical methods to analyze trends, detect anomalies, and make predictions. SciPy's scipy.stats submodule provides a wide range of statistical tests and probability distributions for hypothesis testing and uncertainty analysis.

-	**Machine Learning Integration**: SciPy can be integrated with machine learning libraries like scikit-learn for environmental data classification, regression, clustering, and predictive modeling.

-	**Statistical Modeling**: Environmental scientists can use SciPy for fitting statistical models to data, allowing for the assessment of relationships between environmental variables and the development of predictive models.
